    <h3>At Baia</h3>
    <h4>by Hilda Doolittle</h4>
    <pre>
      I should have thought
      in a dream you would have brought
      some lovely, perilous thing,
      orchids piled in a great sheath,
      as who would say (in a dream)
      I send you this,
      who left the blue veins
      of your throat unkissed.

      Why was it that your hands
      (that never took mine)
      your hands that I could see
      drift over the orchid heads
      so carefully,
      your hands, so fragile, sure to lift
      so gently, the fragile flower stuff—
      ah, ah, how was it

      You never sent (in a dream)
      the very form, the very scent,
      not heavy, not sensuous,
      but perilous—perilous—
      of orchids, piled in a great sheath,
      and folded underneath on a bright scroll
      some word:

      Flower sent to flower;
      for white hands, the lesser white,
      less lovely of flower leaf,

      or

      Lover to lover, no kiss,
      no touch, but forever and ever this.

    <h3>A Lady</h3>
    <h4>by Amy Lowell</h4>
    <pre>
     You are beautiful and faded
     Like an old opera tune
     Played upon a harpsichord;
     Or like the sun-flooded silks
     Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.
     In your eyes
     Smoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes,
     And the perfume of your soul
     Is vague and suffusing,
     With the pungence of sealed spice-jars.
     Your half-tones delight me,
     And I grow mad with gazing
     At your blent colours.

     My vigour is a new-minted penny,
     Which I cast at your feet.
     Gather it up from the dust,
     That its sparkle may amuse you.
    </pre>

    <h3>EAU-FORTE</h3>
    <h4>by F. S. FLINT</h4>
    <pre>
      On black bare trees a stale cream moon
      hangs dead, and sours the unborn buds.

      Two gaunt old hacks, knees bent, heads low,
      tug, tired and spent, an old horse tram.

      Damp smoke, rank mist fill the dark square;
      and round the bend six bullocks come.

      A hobbling, dirt-grimed drover guides
      their clattering feet to death and shame.
    </pre>
