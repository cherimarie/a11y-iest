# A11y-iest

The goal if this project is to create the most accessible website possible using modern build tools and technologies. A site made with only HTML is, of course, completely accessible across screen devices and data connections. But no business wants to be serving a plain HTML site. They want movement, animations triggered by user interactions, video, dynamic routing with a javascript framework, a fully immersive experience using the most exciting bleeding edge javascript! Those are fun sites to build, but we developers don't always put in the effort to ensure that all users can access them. So, my challenge to myself, is to build a flashy, modern site that is utterly accessible.

## Features

These are the core features that this site wants to offer its users.

- Three good poems
- Information about the poets
- Information about the type of poetry
- A fourth poem, selected based on information user submits via a form

## User Stories


## Real Scenarios Served

Browserstack isn't going to cut it here. As people test this site on the devices, networks, and locations they have available, results will be posted here.

| Geographic Location | Network Type & Speed | Device | Browser/User Agent | Other Information | Result |
